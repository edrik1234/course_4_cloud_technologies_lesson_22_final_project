My_Final_Aws_Remote_Control Project:
 
A Python script(in_pc)client_side that triggers script on an AWS EC2 server(server_side)💻☁️.

On the server side, logs are analyzed to count occurrences of different severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, WARN) from /var/log/syslog, then returned as JSON.

The client processes this data into a CSV file and automatically commits and pushes it to a Git repository🔄📁.

Project demonstrates hands-on experience with Python scripting, AWS EC2, log analysis, JSON/CSV handling, and automated version control workflows.

Provides a practical solution for remote log monitoring and automated reporting.
